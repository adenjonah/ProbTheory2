1. Give X,Y continuous random variables whose joint p.d.f is given by :
f (x, y) =
( 1
y , 0 < y < 1, 0 < x < y
0, else
(a) Compute the covariance of X and Y
(b) Compute the Variance of X and Variance of Y
(c) Compute the correlation of X and Y

2. Assume that the joint density of (X, Y ) :
f (x, y) =
(c 1
y e−y , 0 < x < y
0, else
(a) Compute c such that the density if a proper p.d.f
(b) Compute the marginal density of Y
(c) Compute the conditional density X given Y
(d) Compute the Expected value of X2 given Y , E(X2|Y = y)

3. Let X be a uniform random variable on the interval [−1, 1].
(a) Compute the variance of X2.
(b) If X1, X2, ....Xn are independent and identically distributed copies of X and
Z = max(X1, ..., Xn) compute the CDF of Z
(c) Compute the correlation between X and X2?
(d) Are X and X2 independent?

4. Consider the following game. Toss a coin with probability p of Heads. If you toss
Heads, you win $2, if you toss Tails, you win $1.
(a) Assume that you play this game n times and let Sn be your combined winnings.
Compute the moment generating function of Sn, that is, E(etSn ).
(b) Now you roll a fair die and you play the game as many times as the number you
roll. Let Y be your total winnings. Compute E(Y )
