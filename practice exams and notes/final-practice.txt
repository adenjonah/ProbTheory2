1. Toss a fair coin twice. You win $3 if both tosses comes out Heads, lose $1 if no toss
comes out Heads, and win or lose nothing otherwise.
(a) What is the expected number of games you need to play to win once?
(b) Assume that you play this game 400 times. What is, approximately, the prob-
ability that you win at least $240?
(c) Again, assume that you play this game 400 times. Compute (approximately) the
amount of money x such that your winnings will be at least x with probability
0.5. Then, do the same with probability 0.9.

2. Suppose X1 and X2 are iid N (0, 1) random variables. Define:
Y1 = aX1 + X2, and Y2 = X1 + bX2
(a) Find a and b such that Y = (Y1, Y2) is a Gaussian vector with independent
components.
(b) Calculate the mean vector and covariance matrix of Y .
(c) Write the joint density of the random vector Y .
(d) Write an expression for P (Y1 > X1|X1 > 0).
(e) Find the conditional distribution of Y1 − X1 given X1 = x.

3. Let X1, X2, . . . , X100 be independent random variables exponentially distributed with
mean θ = 3 (i.e. their density is f (x) = 1
3 e− x
3 , for x > 0). Let  ̄X be the average of
these variables.
Calculate an approximate value for the probability:

4. Given a lognormal distribution for stock price S defined as:
S = S0eZ
, where Z is normal random variable with mean (r − σ2/2) and variance σ2, where
S0 = 100, r = 0.05, σ = 20%.
(a) Compute the expected value of the function of the random variable E[e−rS].
(b) Compute the probability that S exceeds 100.

5. Suppose that the proportion θ of defective items in a large manufactured lot is un-
known, and the prior distribution of θ is 1/2 with probability 1/2 and 3/4 with
probability 1/2. When 10 items are selected at random from the lot, it is found that
none of them are defective.
(a) What is the probability that from 10 items, none of them are defective?
(b) Determine the posterior distribution of θ, given none items are defective from a
sample of 10 items.
(c) What is the mean and variance of the parameter θ given the data?
