What is the c.d.f of the transformed variable Y = FX (X) where
r (·) = FX (·)
P(Y ⩽ y ) = P(FX (X) ⩽ y ) = P(X ⩽ F −1

Random variable sampling
In general numeric algorithms are set to generate random variables
on [0,1].
in order to generate a variable different from Uniform, the most
common solution is to apply the inverse CDF
Corollary
Let Y have the uniform distribution on [0,1] and let F be a
continous c.d.f with quantile functions F −1. Then X = F −1(Y )
has c.d.f. F.

companies. Denote each company with Xi taking values 1 if
outperforms and zero if not. We are interested in
