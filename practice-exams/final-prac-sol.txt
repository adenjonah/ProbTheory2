1. Toss a fair coin twice. You win $3 if both tosses comes out Heads, lose $1 if no toss
comes out Heads, and win or lose nothing otherwise.
(a) What is the expected number of games you need to play to win once?
SOLUTION: Probability of win once is 1/4. Expected number of games is a
geometric distribution with mean 1
p , so the expected number of trials is 4.
(b) Assume that you play this game 400 times. What is, approximately, the prob-
ability that you win at least $240?
SOLUTION: Denote with P the win/loss after 1 play:
E(P ) = 3 · 1
4 − 1 · 1
4 = 1

V ar(P ) = E(P 2) − E(P )2 = 9 · 1

(c) Again, assume that you play this game 400 times. Compute (approximately) the
amount of money x such that your winnings will be at least x with probability
0.5. Then, do the same with probability 0.9.
SOLUTION: For probability 0.5:
P (  ̄P > x) = P  ̄P − 200

2. Suppose X1 and X2 are iid N (0, 1) random variables. Define:
Y1 = aX1 + X2, and Y2 = X1 + bX2
(a) Find a and b such that Y = (Y1, Y2) is a Gaussian vector with independent
components.
SOLUTION:
Cov(Y1, Y2) = Cov(aX1 + X2, X1 + bX2) = aV ar(X1) + bV ar(X2) = a + b
For multivariate normal, independence is equivalent to zero correlation, so b =
−a.
(b) Calculate the mean vector and covariance matrix of Y .
SOLUTION:
E(Y1) = E(Y2) = 0
V ar(Y1) = V ar(aX1 + X2) = a2 + 1
V ar(Y2) = V ar(X1 − aX2) = 1 + a2
Cov(Y1, Y2) = 0
(c) Write the joint density of the random vector Y .

(d) Write an expression for P (Y1 > X1|X1 > 0).
SOLUTION:
P (Y1 > X1|X1 > 0) = P (aX1 + X2 > X1|X1 > 0)
= P (aX1 + X2 > X1, X1 > 0)
P (X1 > 0)

(e) Find the conditional distribution of Y1 −X1 given X1 = x in terms of conditional
mean and conditional variance.
SOLUTION: Given X1 = x, we have:
Y1 − X1 = aX1 + X2 − X1 = (a − 1)x + X2
Since X2 ∼ N (0, 1) and is independent of X1, the conditional distribution is:
Y1 − X1|X1 = x ∼ N ((a − 1)x, 1)
3
1. Simplify the expression W = Y1 − X1
Substitute the definition of Y1:
W = Y1 − X1
W = (aX1 + X2) − X1
W = (a − 1)X1 + X2
2. Apply the conditional constraint X1 = x
We are looking for the distribution of W conditional on the event X1 = x. The
conditional random variable W | (X1 = x) becomes:
W | (X1 = x) = (a − 1)x + X2
Here, (a − 1)x is a constant, and X2 is a random variable.
3. Determine the distribution of the conditional variable
Since X2 ∼ N (0, 1), and W | (X1 = x) is X2 shifted by the constant C = (a−1)x,
the resulting distribution is Normal.
W | (X1 = x) ∼ N (E[W | X1 = x], Var[W | X1 = x])
Conditional Expectation (Mean):
E[W | X1 = x] = E[(a − 1)x + X2]
= (a − 1)x + E[X2]
= (a − 1)x + 0
= (a − 1)x
Conditional Variance:
Var[W | X1 = x] = Var[(a − 1)x + X2]
= Var[X2] (since adding a constant does not affect variance)
= 1
Conclusion
The conditional distribution of Y1 − X1 given X1 = x is a Normal distribution:
(Y1 − X1) | (X1 = x) ∼ N ((a − 1)x, 1)

3. Let X1, X2, . . . , X100 be independent random variables exponentially distributed with
mean θ = 3 (i.e. their density is f (x) = 1
3 e− x
3 , for x > 0). Let  ̄X be the average of
these variables.
Calculate an approximate value for the probability:

4. Given a lognormal distribution for stock price S defined as:
S = S0eZ
, where Z is normal random variable with mean (r − σ2/2) and variance σ2, where
S0 = 100, r = 0.05, σ = 20%.
(a) Compute the expected value of the function of the random variable E[e−rS].
SOLUTION: Taking into account that the moment generating function of a
standard normal is et2/2 and we can write Z as a linear function of a standard
normal (r − σ2/2) + σ · N (0, 1):
E[e−rS] = e−rS0E[e(r−σ2/2)+σ·N (0,1)]
= e−rS0e(r−σ2/2)E[eσN (0,1)]
= e−rS0e(r−σ2/2)eσ2/2 = S0
(b) Compute the probability that S exceeds 100.

5. Suppose that the proportion θ of defective items in a large manufactured lot is un-
known, and the prior distribution of θ is 1/2 with probability 1/2 and 3/4 with
probability 1/2. When 10 items are selected at random from the lot, it is found that
none of them are defective.
(a) What is the probability that from 10 items, none of them are defective?
SOLUTION: Let A be the event that no items are defective. Using the law of
total probability:
P (A) = P (A|θ = 1/2)P (θ = 1/2) + P (A|θ = 3/4)P (θ = 3/4)
