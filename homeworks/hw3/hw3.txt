Problem Set 3
1. Random variables X and Y have the joint PMF
pX,Y (x, y) =
(c x2 + y2 , if x ∈ {1, 2, 4} and y ∈ {1, 3},
0, otherwise.
(a) What is the value of the constant c ?
(b) What is P(Y < X) ?
(c) What is P(Y > X) ?
(d) What is P(Y = X) ?
(e) What is P(Y = 3) ?
(f) Find the marginal PMFs pX (x) and pY (y).
(g) Find the expectations E[X], E[Y ] and E[XY ].
(h) Find the variances var(X), var(Y ) and var(X + Y ).
Problem 2. Assume that we have a three-sided die with faces numbered 1,2
, and 3 . The PMF for the result of any one roll of this die is
pX (x) =



1/2, if x = 1,
1/4, if x = 2,
1/4, if x = 3,
0, otherwise.
Consider a sequence of six independent rolls of this die, and let Xi be the
random variable corresponding to the i th roll.
(a) What is the probability that exactly three of the rolls have result equal to 3
?
(b) What is the probability that the first roll is 1 , given that exactly two of the
six rolls have result of 1 ?
(c) We are told that exactly three of the rolls resulted in 1 and exactly three
resulted in 2 . Given this information, what is the probability that the sequence
of rolls is 121212 ?
(d) Conditioned on the event that at least one roll resulted in 3, find the condi-
tional PMF of the number of 3 ’s.

Problem 3. Suppose that X and Y are independent, identically distributed,
geometric random variables with parameter p. Show that
P(X = i | X + Y = n) = 1
n − 1 , for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1.
Problem 4. Consider 10 independent tosses of a biased coin with a proba-
bility of heads of p.
(a) Let A be the event that there are 6 heads in the first 8 tosses. Let B be
the event that the 9th toss results in heads. Show that events A and B are
independent.
(b) Find the probability that there are 3 heads in the first 4 tosses and 2 heads
in the last 3 tosses.
(c) Given that there were 4 heads in the first 7 tosses, find the probability that
the 2 nd head occurred during the 4th trial.
(d) Find the probability that there are 5 heads in the first 8 tosses and 3 heads
in the last 5 tosses.
Problem 5. Consider a sequence of independent tosses of a biased coin at
times t = 0, 1, 2, . . .. On each toss, the probability of a ’head’ is p, and the
probability of a ’tail’ is 1 − p. A reward of one unit is given each time that a
’tail’ follows immediately after a ’head.’ Let R be the total reward paid in times
1, 2, . . . , n. Find E[R] and var(R).
Problem 6. Time to failure
Recall that an exponential random variable X ∼ exp(λ) has pdf given by f (x) =
λe−λx on x ≥ 0.
(a) Compute P (X ≥ x).
(b) Compute the mean and standard deviation of X. You need to set up
the necessary integrals, but you can use Wolfram Alpha or another application
to do the computation. (Of course, it will be good for you if you compute the
integrals by hand!)
Solution: First we compute the mean
(c) Suppose that X1 and X2 are independent exp(λ) random variables. Let
T = min (X1, X2). Find the cdf and pdf of T . (Hint: first find a formula for
P (T ≥ t) ?)
Note: for independent continuous random variables X1, X2, you can assume the
following formula:
P (X1 ≥ x1, X2 ≥ x2) = P (X1 ≥ x1) P (X2 ≥ x2) .
(d) Suppose we are testing 3 different brands of light bulbs B1, B2, and B3
whose lifetimes are exponential random variables with mean 1/2, 1/3, and 1/5
years, respectively. Assuming
that all of the bulbs are independent, what is the expected time before one of
the bulb fails. (Hint: part (c) was a warmup for this problem.)

Problem 7 Change of scale.
In this problem we will look at scaling random variables. This is a simple, but
common thing to do. As usual with transformations, if you don’t approach it
systematically, it is easy to make mistakes.
(a) Suppose the random variable X has an exponential distribution with pa-
rameter 1, i.e. X ∼ exp(1). Give the range and pdf for the variables X and
Y = 3X
Sketch the graph of the density functions for each of these variables.
(b) For the random variable X from part (a), find the range and pdf of
W = aX + b, where a and b are constants. Assume a > 0.
(c) Let V = X3. Find the range and pdf of V .
Problem 8 . In this problem we will explore how the transformations in the
previous problem affect the mean and median.
(a) For the variables X, Y, W in the previous problem, assume each of the vari-
ables are given in units of minutes. Find the expected value, variance and
standard deviation of each variable. Be sure to include units in your answer.
What are the units on a and b in the defnition of W ?
(b) For V from the previous problem, compute E[V ]. As usual, you must
set up the integral, but you can use a package to compute the integral.
(c) Compute the median value of both X and V .
