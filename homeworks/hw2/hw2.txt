Problem Set 2
Problem 1 (2.1.6) A box contains r red balls and b blue balls. One ball is selected
at random and its color is observed. The ball is then returned to the box and k
additional balls of the same color are also put into the box. A second ball is then
selected at random, its color is observed, and it is returned to the box together
with k additional balls of the same color. Each time another ball is selected,
the process is repeated. If four balls are selected, what is the probability that
the first three balls will be red and the fourth ball will be blue?
Problem 2 (2.1.6) Consider the following version of the game of craps: The
player rolls two dice. If the sum on the first roll is 7 or 11, the player wins the
game immediately. If the sum on the first roll is 2,3 , or 12, the player loses
the game immediately. However, if the sum on the first roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10
, then the two dice are rolled again and again until the sum is either 7 or 11 or
the original value. If the original value is obtained a second time before either 7
or 11 is obtained, then the player wins. If either 7 or 11 is obtained before the
original value is obtained a second time, then the player loses. Determine the
probability that the player will win this game.
Problem 3 (2.1.6) A machine produces defective parts with three different
probabilities depending on its state of repair. If the machine is in good working
order, it produces defective parts with probability 0.02 . If it is wearing down,
it produces defective parts with probability 0.1. If it needs maintenance, it
produces defective parts with probability 0.3. The probability that the machine
is in good working order is 0.8 , the probability that it is wearing down is 0.1 ,
and the probability that it needs maintenance is 0.1 . Compute the probability
that a randomly selected part will be defective.
Problem 4(2.2.13) Suppose that the probability that any particle emitted by
a radioactive material will penetrate a certain shield is 0.01 . If 10 particles are
emitted, what is the probability that exactly one of the particles will penetrate
the shield?
Problem 5(2.2.16) In the World Series of baseball, two teams A and B play
a sequence of games against each other, and the first team that wins a total of
four games becomes the winner of the World Series. If the probability that team
A will win any particular game against team B is 1/3, what is the probability
that team A will win the World Series?
Problem 6(2.2.17) Two boys A and B throw a ball at a target. Suppose
that the probability that boy A will hit the target on any throw is 1/3 and the
probability that boy B will hit the target on any throw is 1/4. Suppose also
that boy A throws first and the two boys take turns throwing. Determine the
probability that the target will be hit for the first time on the third throw of
boy A.
Problem 7(2.3.7) Suppose that a box contains five coins and that for each
coin there is a different probability that a head will be obtained when the coin
is tossed. Let pi denote the probability of a head when the i th coin is tossed (
i =
1, . . . , 5), and suppose that p1 = 0, p2 = 1/4, p3 = 1/2, p4 = 3/4, and p5 = 1.

a. Suppose that one coin is selected at random from the box and when it is
tossed once, a head is obtained. What is the posterior probability that the i th
coin was selected (i = 1, . . . , 5) ?
b. If the same coin were tossed again, what would be the probability of obtaining
another head?
c. If a tail had been obtained on the first toss of the selected coin and the same
coin were tossed again, what would be the probability of obtaining a head on
the second toss?
Problem 8. (’Binary’ paradox)
For this problem assume that kids are equally probable to be male or female.
Be sure to carefully justify your answers.
(a) Our king had two kids. The older kid is female. What is the probability
that both kids are female?
(b) Our king had two kids. At least one of them is male. What is the probability
that both kids are males?
Problem 9. (The blue taxi)
In a city with one hundred taxis, 1 is blue and 99 are green. A witness observes
a hit-and-run by a taxi at night and recalls that the taxi was blue, so the police
arrest the blue taxi driver who was on duty that night. The driver proclaims
their innocence and hires you to defend them in court. You hire a scientist to
test the witness’ ability to distinguish blue and green taxis under conditions
similar to the night of accident. The data suggests that the witness sees blue
cars as blue 99% of the time and green cars as blue 2% of the time.
Write a speech for the jury to give them reasonable doubt about your client’s
guilt. Your speech need not be longer than the statement of this question. Keep
in mind that most jurors have not taken this course, so an illustrative table may
be easier for them to understand than fancy formulas.
Problem 10. (Dice) There are four dice in a drawer: one D4 (4 sides), one
D6 (6-sides), and two D8 (8 sides). As usual, the sides of a die are numbered 1
to n, where n is the number of sides.
Your friend secretly grabs one of the four dice at random. Let S be the
number of sides on the chosen die.
(a) What is the probability that 4 side appears? What is the probability that 6
side appears? What is the probability that 8 side appears ?
( this is called prior )
(b) Now, without showing it to you, your friend rolls the chosen die and tells
you the result. Let R be the result of the roll. Use Bayes’ rule to find
P (S = s | R = 3) for s = 4, 6, 8. Which die is most likely if R = 3 ?
(c) Which die is most likely if R = 6 ? Hint: You can either repeat the compu-
tation in (b), or you can reason based on your result in (b).
(d) Which die is most likely if R = 7 ? No computations are needed!
Problem 11
In this problem we will use R to simulate flipping a fair coin 50 times. We’ll
use the simulation to explore ’runs’. That is, sequences of all 1 ’s or 0 ’s.
(a) Make up a sequence of length 50 consisting of ones and zeros. Try to make
the sequence look like it was randomly generated by flipping a coin.
2
(b) A run is a sequence of all 1s or all 0s. How long is the longest run in
your answer to part (a)?
(c) Now we will use R to simulate 50 tosses of a fair coin and estimate the
average length of the longest run. The code below simulates one trial. You will
need to use a ’for loop’ to run 10000 trials.
Sample code illustrating the use of rle().
# R code to simulate 50 flips of a fair coin and find the longest run
# rle stands for `run length encoding'.
# rle(trial)$lengths is a vector of the lengths of all the different runs
# in trial.
nflips = 50
trial = rbinom(nflips, 1, 0.5) # Note: binomial(1, 0.5) = bernoulli(0.5)
max_run = max(rle(trial)$lengths)
Sample code illustrating ’for loops’. (These may be useful in the code for
this problem.)
# R code demonstrating `for' loops.
for (j in 1:5) {
print(j^2)
}
(Should produce: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25.)
sum = 0
for (j in 1:5) {
sum = sum + j
}
print(sum)
(Should produce: 15.)
Use R to simulate the average length of the longest run in 50 flips
of a fair coin. Do this three times with 10000 trials each time and
report the three results.
(d) A small modification of your code will let you estimate the probability of
a run of 8 or more in 50 flips. Do this three times with 10000 trials each time.
Report the three results.
