\textbf{Problem 4(b): Find the probability that Alicia arrives before 12:30.}

12:30 is 30 minutes after noon, so we want $P(A < 30)$.

Since $A \sim \text{Uniform}[0,60]$:
$$P(A < 30) = F_A(30) = \frac{30 - 0}{60 - 0} = \frac{30}{60} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Therefore, the probability that Alicia arrives before 12:30 is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
