PROBLEMS SOLVED:
===============

Problem 1: Joint pdf analysis with f(x,y) = c(x² + xy) on [0,1] × [0,1]
- Part (a): Found c = 12/7 and F(x,y) = x²y(4x + 3y)/7
- Part (b): Computed all marginal pdfs and cdfs
- Part (c): E[X] = 5/7, Var(X) = 23/490
- Part (d): Cov(X,Y) = -1/294, Cor(X,Y) = -√15/69
- Part (e): X and Y are NOT independent

Problem 2: Independence check for joint pmf table
- Computed marginal pmfs: P(X=i) = P(Y=j) = 1/3
- Verified X and Y are NOT independent via counterexamples

Problem 3: Correlation analysis for binary random variables
- Part (a): Joint distribution in terms of c, Cov(X,Y) = Cor(X,Y) = 4c - 1
- Part (b): Independence at c = 1/4, perfect correlation at c = 0 or c = 1/2

Problem 4: Uniform arrival times for lunch meeting
- Part (a): f(a,b) = 1/3600, F(a,b) = ab/3600
- Part (b): P(A < 30) = 1/2
- Part (c): P(A < 15, 30 < B < 45) = 1/16 (both methods)
- Part (d): P(A < B + 5) = 167/288 ≈ 0.5799
- Part (e): P(|A - B| ≤ 15) = 7/16

Problem 5: Overlapping sums of exponential random variables
- Identified overlap size = 8 terms
- Cov(X,Y) = 2, Cor(X,Y) = 8/n
