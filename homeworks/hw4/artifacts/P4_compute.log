=== PROBLEM 4: Don't be late! ===
A and B are independent uniform random variables on [0,60]

=== Part (a): Joint pdf f(a,b) and joint cdf F(a,b) ===
For uniform distribution on [0,60]:
f_A(a) = 1/60 for a ∈ [0,60], 0 otherwise
f_B(b) = 1/60 for b ∈ [0,60], 0 otherwise

Since A and B are independent:
f(a,b) = f_A(a) * f_B(b) = (1/60) * (1/60) = 1/3600 for (a,b) ∈ [0,60] × [0,60]

Joint cdf F(a,b) = P(A ≤ a, B ≤ b):
For 0 ≤ a ≤ 60 and 0 ≤ b ≤ 60:
F(a,b) = ∫₀ᵃ ∫₀ᵇ (1/3600) du dv = (1/3600) * a * b = ab/3600

=== Part (b): P(Alicia arrives before 12:30) ===
12:30 is 30 minutes after noon
P(A < 30) = F_A(30) = 30/60 = 1/2
P(A < 30) = 0.5

=== Part (c): P(A < 15 and 30 < B < 45) ===
12:15 is 15 minutes after noon
12:30 is 30 minutes after noon
12:45 is 45 minutes after noon

Method (i): Using independence
P(A < 15) = 15/60 = 1/4
P(30 < B < 45) = (45-30)/60 = 15/60 = 1/4
P(A < 15 and 30 < B < 45) = P(A < 15) * P(30 < B < 45) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16
Result: 0.0625

Method (ii): Area calculation
Total area of [0,60] × [0,60] = 60 * 60 = 3600
Area of [0,15] × [30,45] = 15 * 15 = 225
Probability = 225/3600 = 1/16
Result: 0.0625
Both methods agree: True

=== Part (d): P(A < B + 5) ===
We want P(A - B < 5), or equivalently P(A < B + 5)
This is the region below the line a = b + 5

Using geometric approach:
Total area = 60 × 60 = 3600
We want the area below the line a = b + 5 within [0,60] × [0,60]

The line a = b + 5 intersects:
- Left edge (b = 0): a = 5
- Bottom edge (a = 0): b = -5 (outside domain)
- Top edge (a = 60): b = 55
- Right edge (b = 60): a = 65 (outside domain)

The region above the line a = b + 5 is a triangle with vertices:
(5, 0), (60, 0), (60, 55)
Area above line = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 55 * 55 = 1512.5
Area below line = 3600 - 1512.5 = 2087.5
P(A < B + 5) = 2087.5/3600 = 0.5798611...
P(A < B + 5) = 0.579861
As fraction: 2087.5/3600 = 16700/28800 = 668/1152

=== Part (e): Both wait at most 15 minutes ===
They meet if |A - B| ≤ 15
This is equivalent to -15 ≤ A - B ≤ 15, or B - 15 ≤ A ≤ B + 15

Geometric approach:
We want the region between lines a = b - 15 and a = b + 15
Total area = 60 × 60 = 3600

Area outside the strip (where they don't meet):
Upper triangle: above a = b + 15
- Vertices: (15, 0), (60, 0), (60, 45)
- Area = (1/2) * 45 * 45 = 1012.5

Lower triangle: below a = b - 15
- Vertices: (0, 15), (0, 60), (45, 60)
- Area = (1/2) * 45 * 45 = 1012.5

Total area where they don't meet = 1012.5 + 1012.5 = 2025
Area where they do meet = 3600 - 2025 = 1575
P(they meet) = 1575/3600 = 7/16
P(they meet) = 0.437500 = 1575/3600 = 7/16

=== VERIFICATION ===
Part (b): P(A < 30) = 0.5
Part (c): P(A < 15, 30 < B < 45) = 0.0625 = 0.0625
Part (d): P(A < B + 5) = 0.579861
Part (e): P(|A - B| ≤ 15) = 0.437500 = 7/16
