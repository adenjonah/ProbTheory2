=== PROBLEM 3: Correlation ===
X and Y are random variables with:
P(X = 1) = P(X = -1) = 1/2
P(Y = 1) = P(Y = -1) = 1/2
Let c = P(X = 1 and Y = 1)

=== Part (a): Joint distribution, Cov(X,Y), and Cor(X,Y) ===
Joint distribution:
P(X = 1, Y = 1) = c
P(X = 1, Y = -1) = P(X = 1) - P(X = 1, Y = 1) = 1/2 - c
P(X = -1, Y = 1) = P(Y = 1) - P(X = 1, Y = 1) = 1/2 - c
P(X = -1, Y = -1) = 1 - c - (1/2 - c) - (1/2 - c) = 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 + c = c

Total probability: 1

Expected values:
E[X] = 1 * (1/2) + (-1) * (1/2) = 0
E[Y] = 1 * (1/2) + (-1) * (1/2) = 0

E[XY] = 1*1*c + 1*(-1)*(1/2-c) + (-1)*1*(1/2-c) + (-1)*(-1)*c
      = c - (1/2-c) - (1/2-c) + c
      = c - 1/2 + c - 1/2 + c + c
      = 4c - 1
E[XY] = 4*c - 1

Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] = 4*c - 1 - 0 * 0 = 4*c - 1

Variance calculations:
E[X²] = 1² * (1/2) + (-1)² * (1/2) = 1
E[Y²] = 1² * (1/2) + (-1)² * (1/2) = 1
Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])² = 1 - (0)² = 1
Var(Y) = E[Y²] - (E[Y])² = 1 - (0)² = 1

Cor(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y) / √(Var(X)Var(Y)) = 4*c - 1 / √(1 * 1)
         = 4*c - 1 / √1 = 4*c - 1 / 1
Cor(X,Y) = 4*c - 1

=== Part (b): Independence and perfect correlation ===
For independence, we need Cov(X,Y) = 0:
4*c - 1 = 0
c = 1/4

For 100% correlation, we need |Cor(X,Y)| = 1:
|4*c - 1| = 1
|4c - 1| = 1
This gives us: 4c - 1 = 1 or 4c - 1 = -1
4c - 1 = 1  ⟹  c = 1/2
4c - 1 = -1 ⟹  c = 0

Constraint verification:
Since c = P(X=1, Y=1), we need 0 ≤ c ≤ 1
Also, P(X=1, Y=-1) = 1/2 - c ≥ 0, so c ≤ 1/2
And P(X=-1, Y=1) = 1/2 - c ≥ 0, so c ≤ 1/2
Therefore: 0 ≤ c ≤ 1/2

Independence: c = 1/4 = 0.25 ✓ (within [0, 1/2])
Perfect positive correlation: c = 1/2 = 0.5 ✓ (within [0, 1/2])
Perfect negative correlation: c = 0 = 0.0 ✓ (within [0, 1/2])

=== VERIFICATION ===
c = 1/4: Cov(X,Y) = 0 = 0.000, Cor(X,Y) = 0 = 0.000
c = 1/2: Cov(X,Y) = 1 = 1.000, Cor(X,Y) = 1 = 1.000
c = 0: Cov(X,Y) = -1 = -1.000, Cor(X,Y) = -1 = -1.000
