## 🎯 HIGH-YIELD TOPICS (Post-M2 Emphasis)

### MUST KNOW (Memorize)
- [ ] CLT formula: $Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$
- [ ] Bayes: $P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$
- [ ] Normal standardization: $Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$
- [ ] Independence test: $f(x,y) = f_X(x) \cdot f_Y(y)$
- [ ] Continuity correction: $\pm 0.5$
- [ ] Bivariate normal: independence $\Leftrightarrow \rho = 0$

### MUST UNDERSTAND (Concepts)
- [ ] When to apply CLT (large n, finite variance)
- [ ] Difference between sober/dizzy Monty Hall
- [ ] Linear combinations of normals are normal
- [ ] Law of Total Expectation
- [ ] Conjugate prior updates
- [ ] Lognormal for stock prices

### QUICK LOOKUP (Know Where to Find)
- [ ] Distribution formulas (Appendix B)
- [ ] MGF formulas (Section 5.1)
- [ ] Jacobian method (Section 4.6)
- [ ] Order statistics (Section 4.7)
- [ ] Confidence interval formulas (Section 6.4)

## ⏱️ EXAM TIME MANAGEMENT

### Time Allocation Strategy (90 minutes)
| Time | Task | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 0-5 min | Read all problems | Identify types using decision tree |
| 5-10 min | Choose order | Start with most familiar |
| 10-40 min | Problem 1 | Aim for complete solution |
| 40-70 min | Problem 2 | Don't get stuck on one part |
| 70-85 min | Problem 3 | Get partial credit if needed |
| 85-90 min | Review | Check arithmetic, add units |

### Per-Problem Strategy
- [ ] Part (a): Usually straightforward - 8 min
- [ ] Part (b): Builds on (a) - 10 min
- [ ] Part (c): Conceptual/limiting - 12 min

## 🔍 DURING THE EXAM

### Initial Problem Analysis (per problem)
1. [ ] Identify problem type using decision tree
2. [ ] List given information
3. [ ] Identify what's asked
4. [ ] Note relevant formulas
5. [ ] Check if variables are independent

### Problem-Solving Checklist
- [ ] Write down all given information
- [ ] State assumptions clearly
- [ ] Show ALL work (partial credit!)
- [ ] Box/highlight final answers
- [ ] Check units and reasonableness
- [ ] If stuck, write relevant formulas

### Common Traps to Avoid
- [ ] Forgetting continuity correction
- [ ] Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A)
- [ ] Assuming independence without checking
- [ ] Wrong integration limits
- [ ] Forgetting to normalize Bayesian posterior
- [ ] Using wrong parameterization
