\textbf{Problem 3(b): For what value(s) of $c$ are $X$ and $Y$ independent? For what value(s) of $c$ are $X$ and $Y$ 100\% correlated?}

\textbf{Independence:}
$X$ and $Y$ are independent when $\text{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$.
$$4c - 1 = 0 \implies c = \frac{1}{4}$$

\textbf{Perfect correlation:}
$X$ and $Y$ are 100\% correlated when $|\text{Cor}(X,Y)| = 1$.
$$|4c - 1| = 1$$

This gives us two cases:
\begin{align}
4c - 1 &= 1 \implies c = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{(perfect positive correlation)}\\
4c - 1 &= -1 \implies c = 0 \quad \text{(perfect negative correlation)}
\end{align}

\textbf{Constraint verification:}
Since $c = P(X = 1, Y = 1)$ is a probability, we need $0 \leq c \leq 1$.
Additionally, we need:
- $P(X = 1, Y = -1) = \frac{1}{2} - c \geq 0 \implies c \leq \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(X = -1, Y = 1) = \frac{1}{2} - c \geq 0 \implies c \leq \frac{1}{2}$

Therefore, the valid range is $0 \leq c \leq \frac{1}{2}$.

All our solutions satisfy this constraint:
- Independence: $c = \frac{1}{4}$ ✓
- Perfect positive correlation: $c = \frac{1}{2}$ ✓  
- Perfect negative correlation: $c = 0$ ✓

\textbf{Verification:} At $c = \frac{1}{4}$: $\text{Cor}(X,Y) = 4(\frac{1}{4}) - 1 = 0$ ✓
