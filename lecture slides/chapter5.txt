5.1 Introduction
▶ several special families of distributions that are widely used in
applications of probability and statistics.
▶ discrete and continuous distributions of univariate, bi- variate,
and multivariate types. The discrete univariate distributions
are the families of Bernoulli, binomial, hypergeometric,
Poisson, negative binomial, and geometric distributions.
▶ The continuous univariate distributions are the families of
normal, lognormal, gamma, exponential, and beta
distributions.
▶ multivariate discrete distributions, and the bivariate normal
family of bivariate continuous distributions.

▶ dependent Bernoulli random variables.
▶ A common source of dependent Bernoulli random variables is
sampling without replacement from a finite population.
▶ Suppose that a finite population consists of a known number
of successes and failures. If we sample a fixed number of units
from that population, the number of successes in our sample
will have a distribution that is a member of the family of
hypergeometric distributions.

5.6 The normal distribution
▶ The most widely used model for random variables with
continuous distributions is the family of normal distributions.
▶ These distributions are the first ones we shall see whose
p.d.f.’s cannot be integrated in closed form
▶ tables of the c.d.f. or computer programs are necessary in
order to compute probabilities and quantiles for normal
distributions
▶ random variables studied in various physical experiments often
have distributions that are approximately normal. For
example, a normal distribution will usually be a close
approximation to the distribution of the heights or weights of
individuals in a homogeneous population of people, corn
stalks, or mice, or to the distribution of the tensile strength of
pieces of steel produced by a certain process

▶ If a large random sample is taken from some distribution, then
even though this distribution is not itself approximately
normal, a consequence of the central limit theorem is that
many important functions of the observations in the sample
will have distributions which are approximately normal.
▶ In particular, for a large random sample from any distribution
that has a finite variance, the distribution of the average of
the random sample will be approximately normal

the volatility of the stock price.

Properties of Bivariate Normal Distributions
▶ For random variables with a bivariate normal distribution, we
find that being independent is equivalent to being
uncorrelated.
▶ Linear combinations of bivariate normal are normal
▶ Conditional Distributions. The conditional distribution of X2
given that X1 = x1 is the normal distribution with mean and

Example
The heights of the wives have a mean of 66.8 inches and a
standard deviation of 2 inches, the heights of the husbands have a
mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 2 inches, and the
correlation between these two heights is 0.68. We shall determine
the probability that the wife will be taller than her husband given
that the heights are multivariate normal.

5.7 The Gamma Distributions
X denote the height of the wife, and let Y denote the height of her
husband, then we must determine the value of Pr (X − Y > 0).
Since X and Y have a bivariate normal distribution, X − Y has
normal distribution all we need to do is compute the mean and
variance
E (X − Y ) = E (X ) − E (Y ) = 66.8 − 70 = −3.2
Var (X −Y ) = Var (X )+Var (Y )−2ρσ1σ2 = 4+4−2·.68·2·2 = 2.56
This the standard deviation of X − Y is 1.6. Transform to a
standard normal:
Pr (X −Y > 0) = Pr
 X − Y + 3.2
1.6 > 3.2/1.6

Example A ”Normal” appointment.
A man and a woman make an appointment at 12 : 00pm at the
Palma Square. The arrival time of the man is normally distributed
with mean 11:55 and standard deviation 10 minutes, and the
woman’s arrival time is normally distributed with mean 12 : 05
with an SD of 8 minutes. If
they can wait for each other for at most 15 minutes, what is the
chance that they actually meet?
Let X = the man’s arrival time relative to 12 : 00pm and Y = the
woman’s arrival time relative to 12:00pm. Then, X ∼ N −5, 102
and Y ∼ N 5, 82. Let W = X − Y ∼ N −5 − 5, 102 + 82.
Then, the chance is
P(|X − Y | ⩽ 15) = P(−15 ⩽ W ⩽ 15)

The Exponential Distributions
Exponential distribution is the continuous counterpart to the
Geometric distribution.
Recall that a Geometric random variable counts the number of
failures before the first success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials.
The story of the Exponential distribution is analogous, but we are
now waiting for a success in continuous time, where successes
arrive at a rate of λ successes per unit of time.
The average number of successes in a time interval of length t is
λt, though the actual number of successes varies randomly.
An Exponential random variable represents the waiting time until
the first arrival of a success.

Memoriless property
Exponential distributions start fresh i.e.
P(X > t + h | X > t) = P(X > h)
What are the implications of the memoryless property? If you’re
waiting at a bus stop and the time until the bus arrives has an
Exponential distribution, then con- ditional on your having waited
30 minutes, the bus isn’t due to arrive soon.
The distribution simply forgets that you’ve been waiting for half an
hour, and your re- maining wait time is the same as if you had just
shown up to the bus stop. If the lifetime of a machine has an
Exponential distribution, then no matter how long the machine has
been functional, conditional on having lived that long, the machine
is as good as new: there is no wear-and-tear effect that makes the
machine more likely to break down soon.

5.7 The Gamma Distributions
Fred lives in Blissville, where buses always arrive exactly on time,
with the time between successive buses fixed at 10 minutes. He
arrives at the bus stop at a uniformly random time . (a) What is
the distribution of how long Fred has to wait for the next bus?
What is the average time that Fred has to wait?
(b) Given that the bus has not yet arrived after 6 minutes, what is
the probability that Fred will have to wait at least 3 more minutes?
(c) Fred moves to Blotchville, a city with inferior urban planning
and where buses are much more erratic. Now, when any bus
arrives, the time until the next bus arrives is an Exponential
random variable with mean 10 minutes. Fred arrives at the bus
stop at a random time, not knowing how long ago the previous bus
came. What is the distribution of Fred’s waiting time for the next
bus? What is the average time that Fred has to wait?

Relation to Arrivals Poisson process
Suppose that arrivals occur according to a Poisson process with
rate β.Let Zk be the time until the kth arrival for k = 1, 2, ....
Define Y1 = Z1 and Yk = Zk − Zk−1 for k ⩾ 2. Then Y1, Y2, ...
are i.i.d. and they each have the exponential distribution with
parameter β.
