Although gambling dates back thousands of years the birth of
modern probability is considered to be a 1654 letter from the
flemish aristocrat and notorious gambler Chevalier de Mere to the
mathematician Blaise Pascal. The letter said :
I used to be even money that i would get at least one 6 in 4 rolls
of a die. The probability is 4 times the probability of getting a 6 in
one roll of a die i.e. 4/6. I had the advantage and i was making
money. Now i bet even money that within 24 rolls of two dice i
would get a double 6. This has the same advantage 24/36 but i
am losing money. Why?

1.2/1.3 Interpretation of Probability / Events
How do we mathematically define a random experiment ?
What we have are:
▶ outcomes : which tell you exactly what happens
▶ events : sets containing certain outcomes
▶ probability : attaches to every event the likelihood that it
happens

1.4 Sample space
The sample space S is simply the list (set) of all possible
outcomes. List must be :
▶ Mutually exclusive
▶ At the ”right” granularity
The complement of a set A is defined as the set that contains all
the elements of the sample space S that do not belong to A.
Events : a subset of the sample space

3. P(Ac ) = 1 − P(A). More generally, if A, B ∈ G with A ⊆ B, then
P(B − A) = P(B) − P(A).
4. If A ⊆ B P(A) ⩽ P(B).

1.7 Counting methods
One simple way of calculating the probability of an event involves
counting the number of outcomes in the event and number of
outcomes in the sample space.
Listing all outcomes is very inefficient, especially if their number is
very large. We will , therefore, learn a few counting techniques,
starting with a trivial, but conceptually important fact.
If an experiment consists in two stages and the first stage has m
outcomes and the second stage has n outcomes regardless of the
outcome of the first stage, then the experiment as a whole has
m × n outcomes.

The most likely sum when rolling two dice is 7, which can be
achieved with the following outcomes:
(1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1).
There are 6 outcomes that result in a sum of 7. Since the total
number of outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 × 6 = 36, the
probability is:
P(sum = 7) = 6
36 = 1
6 .
P(sum = 2) = P(sum = 12) = 1/36
P(sum = 3) = P(sum = 11) = 2/36
P(sum = 4) = P(sum = 10) = 3/36
P(sum = 5) = P(sum = 9) = 4/36
P(sum = 6) = P(sum = 8) = 5/36
P(sum = 7) = 6/36

Let’s go back to De Mere’s game. What is the probability that in 4
rolls he gets at least one 6?
▶ Identify the sample space of equally likely outcomes,
▶ Count the number of outcomes : there are 64 possibilities for the 4
times the dice roll
▶ Compute the number of good outcomes In this case is 64 − 54.
Therefore
P(Win) = 1 − P(no 6 in 4 rolls) = 1 − 54/64

Game 2 of De Mere’s game. Now i bet even money that within
24 rolls of two dice i would get a double 6. Steps:
1. **Sample Space**: Each roll of two dice has 36 outcomes. For
24 rolls, there are:
3624 possible outcomes.
2. **Number of Good Outcomes**: At least one double 6 is
rolled. This can be calculated as:
Good outcomes = 3624 − 3524.
3. **Probability**:

The total number of possibilities is 612
The number of the outcomes that would contain each one of the
six numbers twice will be equal with the arrangements of the 6
pairs k = 6 of 2 elements. This is :
 12
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2

= 12!
2!6
consequently the probability of happening is

Playing cards. A deck of 52 cards contains 13 hearts. Suppose
that the cards are shuffled and equally distributed among four
players A,B,C and D so each player receive 13 cards. We shall
determine the probability that a player A will receive 6 hearts,
player B will receive 4 hearts, player C will receive 2 hearts and
player D one heart.

Adjusting for overcounting
In many counting problems, it is not easy to directly count each
possibility once and only once.
For example, if we have exactly double-counted each possibility, we
can divide by 2 to get the correct count.
Example (Teams)
Consider of group of 4 people.
How many ways to form a 2 person committee
How many ways to break the people into two teams of two?

Example (Poker)
Start with a shuffled deck of cards and distribute all 52 cards to 4
players, 13 cards to each.
A: What is the probability that each player gets an Ace?
B: Next, assume that you are a player and you get a single Ace.
What is the probability now that each player gets an Ace?

Example (Poker)
A: If any ordering of cards is equally likely, then any position of the
four Aces in the deck is also equally likely. There are 52
4

possibilities for the positions (slots) for the 4 aces. Out of these,
the number of positions that give each player an Ace is 13 : pick
the first slot among the cards that the first player gets, then the
second slot among the second player’s cards, then the third and
the fourth slot.
The answer is 134
(52

Consider the aces to be on top of the pack and distribute them at
random into the slots 1-52
The first Ace goes into one slot and is gonna land to one player
the second Ace cannot go into the 13 slots so the chance of the
second Ace be placed with a different player is 39
51
the third Ace cannot go into the 26 slots so the chance of the
second Ace be placed with a different player is 26

the 4th Ace cannot go into the 39 slots so the chance of the
second Ace be placed with a different player is 13

All these combinations are equally likely.

Is sample space always the same?
Sit 3 women and 3 men at random (1 ) in a row of chairs and (2)
around the table. Compute the probability in case (1) that all
women sit together.
Since we have 3 women we have 3! ways to arrange them. After
we arrange them we have a block of 3 women plus 3 men that can
be arranged in 4! ways.
Thus the answer is : 4!3!
6!
For case (2) pick a man , and sit him first. Then the total number
of choices is 5!. Then we have 3! ways in which to arrange the
women and and 2 men and a group of women that gives us 3!3! .
Thus the answer is 3
